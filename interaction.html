<h1>About Interaction</h1>

<p>Interaction was the first social web platform, released in 1995. It originated in a pioneering web based message board 
developed by Terje Norderhaug in the fall of 1994. It later pioneered support for server-side XML and XSLT, 
providing a powerful dynamic server for web professionals.</p>

  <h2>User Reviews</h2>
  
  <blockquote>
  "Interaction is a great tool. I'm currently using it to support a web-based bulletin board that is used extensively by students in a web-enhanced distance learning class that I teach. It is a little confusing to set up, and much of its considerable power is not readily apparent, but this is one program with a whole lot of potential! And Terje Norderhaug, the program's author, issues frequent updates and bug fixes and also responds quickly to messages from his users."
